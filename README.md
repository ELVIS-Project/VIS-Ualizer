# VIS-Ualizer
VIS-Ualizer is a JavaScript based visualiation extension for the [VIS-Framework](https://github.com/ELVIS-Project/vis-framework) based on [D3.js](http://d3js.org), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), and [Flask-API](http://flaskapi.org). VIS-Ualizer can be used in lieu of matplotlib in conjunction with the VIS-Framework, or perhaps [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/), and will eventually become part of the [VIS-Client](https://github.com/ELVIS-Project/vis-client).
